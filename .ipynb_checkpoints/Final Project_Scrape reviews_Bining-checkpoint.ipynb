It was my first time using the bike so I waited for the light to turn green showing it was docked.

Customer service was not understanding at all and would only refund 50% due to \"User Error\". I asked what else I should have done as a user to make sure the bike was docked and the representative told me to wait for the green light. When I explained that I did wait for the green light, the representative told me I was not correct because their system did not show a green light. Now I am out $70 through no fault of my own with no good faith full refund or credit from Divvy's customer service. As a first time user of this product, this is no way to build a customer base.

      "So I got my first Divvy bike with a 30 mins pass to get to university. The bike was not bad I just had to adjust the height of the seat. Some people said that the bikes are heavy and it is hard to ride them. Well they are not entirely wrong. The bike was heavier than usual and it only had 3 gears so you could not go very fast with it, but I cannot say that it was very hard to ride, it was ok.I got my pass via the Divvy mobile app. You can download it from app store and google play. I am going to be honest with you, the app officially sucks! After refreshing and reseting multiple times I was able to get to the page that gives the pass. After paying the fee the app gives you a code that you enter on the keyboard next to your chosen bike and the dock releases it for you. Then a timer appears on the app that counts your riding time. You can also buy passes at the station but I should warn you that they do only accept credit cards (no debit cards or gift cards).There is a map on the app that shows you where is each station and how many bikes and empty docks it has. When you wanna get a bike you touch the plan a ride button on the app. Since it is 3$ for only 30 minutes you have to be careful and plan your ride ahead and make sure there are empty docks at your destination. When you wanna return the bike you just have to take it to an empty dock and push the bike forward until the dock grabs it. Then a green light appears that means the bike is successfully attached. Be careful if you do not put back the bike correctly you could be charged for a very long time. To make sure, you can refresh the app and the timer on top of it disappears. To sum up, I think that this is a good service that still needs work, but if you are looking for a healthy and cheap way to get around I definitely recommend it.\n",

      "While in town visiting for the weekend, we rented two bikes so that we could ride with our hosts. There are many locations, in popular spots, so pretty convenient for us. One can rent with just a credit card, or by using the app, while creating an account, which is easy.The first rental went fine, although checking the bikes in was questionable, as the kiosk was offline when we went to rent again. While on hold to report the issue, a technician arrived and rebooted the kiosk. We were then able to take bikes out. The bikes are comfortable, and very sturdy (also heavy), but with three speeds they were fine for the bike path near Lake Shore Drive. Overall a pretty good service.\n",

      "I want to really like this service. The idea is fantastic and I'm sure the teams involved worked very hard to implement this. Let me start by saying that the bike I rode was smooth, the experience of riding in Chicago was both exhilarating and satisfying. I highly recommend giving it a try and I hope they remain in service for a long time to come. Today was the first day that I attempted to buy a pass and ride a bike. I bought my pass using the app, located the nearest dock, followed the process of keying in the code to unlock the bike, the lights first turned orange and then green. I put my hand on the handle bar to pull it off the dock and it stayed put. No matter what I tried I could not take the bike off the dock. I realized that the bike never unlocked for whatever be the reason. I looked the FAQs in the app, there is nothing there about troubleshooting unlocking a bike (code correct but dock didn't disengage lock) I called their call center and was on hold for 10 minutes, in the end I did not get to speak with anyone. The app displays the unlock code only once, I could not use the code to unlock a different bike. You are made to provide your phone number and email address however the code is neither emailed to you nor texted. Neither could I purchase another pass. It was all very frustrating, the app just displayed the time elapsed, calories, start point end point. I headed to the kiosk and purchased another pass with the intention of appealing for a refund at a later time. With the new code in hand I successfully unlocked a bike and tried to key in my destination in the Divvy app in order to point to the closest dock to my destination. Lo and behold there was a button at the bottom of the map \"Unlock Bike\" I don't know whether I'll be able to use the loaded pass for my return trip but I will try and see. I wont need a refund if it works. There needs to be better instruction, troubleshooting, the user experience of the app definitely needs a little more thought and improvement. Will I rent another Divvy? Absolutely and so should you!\n",

      "Ok, I had 15 people in our group. You can only take 4 bikes out under one credit card. So you will have to use multiple credit cards if you have more than4 to rent.Also, use the divvy locator app to find stations close to where you are and how many bikes are there. So when you want to turn them back in you have to find a station with enough empty spots. Kind of a challenge with a large group. And we had problems at the first station because there were two defective bikes that we couldn’t release from the stand. I ended up calling the customer service line three times and visiting two stands before getting all the bikes. The touch screen at the kiosk was hard to use (screen couldn’t read our button pressing). And once you pay and get the code to release the bikes you only have 5 minutes before it expires. Some would take the code right away and some you had to enter several times before accepting. If you go past 5 minutes you have to re-dock all the bikes and start all over. AND if you plan on taking a nice leisurely bike ride on the Lakeshore Trail, forget about it. There are way too many people that apparently are training for the Tour de France or something because they are flying around at top speeds, yelling at you if you aren’t accommodating them. I had 13 year olds and even though it said you had to be 16, they were fine on these bikes. Easy to ride even though they are well-broken in at this point. Great idea and value but you may need lots of patience.\n",

      "My wife and I were looking forward to using the Divvy bikes along the lakeside in Chicago. I downloaded the Divvy App on my phone having first checked it would be possible to hire two bikes using the same debit card. We successfully secured the first bike however when I tried to unlock the second bike I was presented with a message saying I couldn’t have a bike at this time. After numerous attempts we tried to use the kiosk but the payment was rejected. I used three Visa cards including an American Express Card. All were rejected.Eventually, I called a number that we found on the App (the telephone number shown on the Kiosk was alpha numerical so would not work in my phone). I’m sorry to say the gentleman I spoke to after a very long wait was super dumb. I explained very clearly and on numerous occasions what I had done but he was unable to think of a solution other than putting the one bike we had successfully hired back into the docking station and starting all over again (I tried this without success). Eventually after 15 minutes I suggested we try a different docking station and rang off. The next docking station was manned by a young women. We explained our problem and she said she did not know why the app would not work for the second bike. She did however say that the kiosks do not accept cards issued from abroad. Can you believe it! When it comes to payment processing the US has always been behind other parts of the world (e.g. chip and pin).She kindly offered us the second bike free of charge. A good solution for now but not for later on in the day or on future days unless we bumped into her again. I have to assume hiring two bikes on one card cannot be done with an international card. We had a great time cycling on the lakeside. We cycled for many miles in a very safe (car free) and beautiful environment. Come on Chicago. We’re not all American you know. You should be trying harder to encourage more tourists to your beautiful city.\n",

      "We loved these bikes and found them very easy to use. It was a very hot day and after attending a craft fair we didn’t want to walk any further. A bike ride along the lake seemed like a relief from the heat! On a whim we purchased the 24 hr pass! We were hooked! In those 24 hours we ended up seeing much more of the city than we intended! We rode to Lincoln Park, Wrigley Field, the Bean, Zoo, Navy Pier, Willis Tower, Field House, Art Institute, Soldier Field and several museums. The bike paths were easy to navigate, we saved on transportation and as a bonus had a mini workout!The paths were pretty level and the bikes have gears to help the small inclines we encountered. A few days later when we had to get to our boat ride at the pier, rather than taking an Uber or Lyft, it was easier to get another 24 hour pass. We were at our destination in 10 mins! After dinner and the boat ride we picked up some bikes and rode back to the hotel. The bonus being the next day we were able to enjoy the remaining time on our pass!There were bikes available at all locations, some of which had friendly staff on site to help. The bikes were sturdy and well maintained. There are plenty of spots to pick up and drop off!This made our trip and would recommend it for all ages. \n",

      "We were in Hyde Park to visit the University of Chicago and wanted to go Downtown for a day. Divvy Bikes made that possible without needing to take the CTA or the Metro or the South Shore Line, all possible alternatives. The day was beautiful and we were able to ride along the Lake Front from Hyde Park to the Art Institute. Once we crossed the outer drive at 55th street using the underpass, it was beautiful riding with no traffic lights and no cars. Time for an easy ride, about 35 minutes. Divvy Bikes was easy to use for a full 24 hour duration that allowed us to get on and off downtown as we pleased. We had a little trouble at two docking or parking spots where the codes did not work, but we managed to get it straight within a few minutes (by replacing the two bikes we took out and then starting over again for the three bikes that we needed. I recommend biking around Chicago from Hyde Park to downtown. Bring your own helmet.\n",

      "New Fare Structure!\n",
      "First, please ignore the one star reviews that say \"it isn't clear I have to return the bike in 30 minutes\". It's right there on the machine when you dip your card in, so there' s no \"scam\" going on, just folks who don't take the time to read the instructions. The new fare structure has a $15 \"explorer pass\" which allows you to take the bike out for up to 3 hours without re-docking, There's also a $3 option for a single 30 minute ride. They keep adding more bikes and stations, so the system keeps getting better.\n",

      "What an easy way to see Chicago\n",
      "Got a Divvy bike across from the Hilton Chicago. Checked out their bike program first online, then hit the streets. $3/30 min with credit card. If bike is lost or stolen, then $1200 charge. Easy to find other Divvy racks to dock your bike. Make sure the green light is lit before you walk away from bike and check the area you want to bike to, to see if there is available dock for your bike. 3 speed bikes with baskets. Chicago isn't the most bike friendly town, so you'll be dodging peds. Overall, I really liked using this program for my visit to Chicago.\n",

      "Good concept but needs work\n",
      "Loved the concept of this! Being able to cycle from place to place and return your bike so no worrying about locking it to anything. This was great as visiting from the UK means we obviously couldn't bring our own bikes! The bikes were heavy but were easy to ride. I think we had 4 or 5 different bikes throughout the day, generally all were in good condition with the exception of the last one. Chicago by bike is a good way to go and this concept is brilliant.Bikes were hard to get out of the locks and also at times hard to put back in again!Would recommend using these though as made us be able to see alot more of the city on our short trip. \n",

      "The $9.95 day pass is a good deal, but be prepared to switch bikes every half hour...not a second more. As a frustrated reviewer noted, you will be billed. However, quite fun to ride along the lake, get to the museums and the Navy Pier, Millenium Park, the Bean, etc. The instructions could be made easier for us folks getting up in years. Still a great way to see the lakefront.\n",

      "They are so well organized, we took a 24Hour pass (Keep a watch on the clock because you have to return back to the stand every 30 mins unless you want to pay ofcourse- the app is amazing, it will guide you to the Divvy stand close to you)We were cycling around Downtown for close to 6 hours :) I think Chicago is soo pretty that driving around it would be an injustice. Stop at good spots, do not miss to capture the beautiful sunset. I am sure you will love it as much as I did :)\n",

      "Not For People Unfamiliar with Divvy's Deceptive Fee Structure\n",
      "I got the $9.95 day pass. I was billed $102 because I either didn't see or understand their rental policy requiring you to check in your bicycle every 30 minutes. I had the bike for 22 hours. I had problems checking the bike out and when I called support they had to reboot the station software twice before I was able to check the bike out. During this frustrating period I didn't see any contractual obligations to check in the bike every 30 minutes.When I complained about the billing to customer service they reduced my fee by $50 which I found to be unacceptable. I disputed the charges with my credit card company and they honored my contention and in the end I was only charged $9.95.If you're unfamiliar with the Chicago Metro area Divvy's 30 minute check in requirement and the fallibility of their network may cost you more grief than the convenience of their bicycles.The bikes are 3 speed and are generally suitable for typical short recreational/commuter rides.Their fee structure and use policies need to be more clearly stated and printed on your receipt and at the rental kiosk.\n",

      "Many places rent bikes for $10/hour. Divvy is $10 for the day as long as you swap out the bikes every 30 minutes. It was easy to do. We picked up the bikes along the water from by millennium park. We biked south along the river, swapping out at McCormick Place. Then we went to the Museum of Science and Industry. After a few hours we took bikes from the station in front of the museum and cycled back, swapping out again at McCormick. It is a fantastic dedicated path,not near any cars and very well maintain\n",

      "Enjoy riding in Chicago\n",
      "Chicago has some great trails to ride on and also see the sights Especially along the lake. These bikes are decent to get around. Mind you if you are avid rider you should rent a real road bike but these are truly just a bike. They are decently maintained but as one review said the fees can add up. I thought i was getting charged $10 for the day but ended up at $17. You really need to only go from docking point to docking point because they are only allotting you 30 minutes-at a time to ride before extra charges kick in. I know people in my home town that just go to the next docking point under the 30 minute time then take the same bike out and go to the next stop. Still would rent them again but you need to know how they charge.\n",
